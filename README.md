# Diabetes Detection - Flask Web App ü©∫

This is an End-to-End Machine Learning Project to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes.
The model is trained using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and deployed as an interactive Flask web application.

# üìä Dataset Details

Features:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: 0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic

# Shape:

(636, 9) entries and features.

Outcome Distribution:

0 (Non-diabetic): 435 samples

1 (Diabetic): 201 samples

üñ•Ô∏è Web Application (Flask)
Users can input their medical data via a simple HTML form.

Upon submission, the model predicts and displays:

"Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic".
